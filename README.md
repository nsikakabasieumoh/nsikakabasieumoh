### Hi, I'm Nsikakabasi Umoh

I'm a mechanical engineer, but I'm building my career capital in web development (and anywhere programming takes me). I know the journey will be long, stressful and unforgiving, but I have chosen this path to walk. I'm using GitHub to showcase my project's codes and [medium](https://medium.com/@nsikakabasieumoh) to articulate my processes. I hope you benefit from any project posted.
